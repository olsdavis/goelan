# **Goelan**, high performance Minecraft.

Goelan is a Minecraft server written in Go. It is currently under development.

Some parts of the code are inspired or taken from other never finished open source projects in Go.

## Discord community server

Join now the Discord server of the Goelan community: find help and resources, share and discuss, and follow Goelan's development with the entire community! Join the server by clicking on this [link](https://discord.gg/cpDDD7X).

## Pros & Cons

- *Written in Go.* A trending open source language, which is fast and compiled; its main advantage is the "go routines": they are lightweight threads which can be ran by millions in parallel. This allows a high level of parallelism—which is, of course, well handled by Goelan!
- *Non-official server.* As any other non-official Minecraft server (except perhaps Spigot, which is a fork/extension of the official Minecraft server), there is no guarantee that you will have an update for the new version or that the server is 100% compatible; you are using the hard work of voluntary developers which do not have access *officially* to the necessary information to develop such a program.

## Special Thanks

- To http://wiki.vg, *the ultimate Minecraft protocol resource*.
